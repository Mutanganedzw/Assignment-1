Documentation on how the Application will be beneficial to Students.
This Documentation will help to understand how I created my Application on Android Studios using the language Java Script. First I named my file IMAD ASSIGNMENT 1, inside the file I have two other files which are namely “activity_main.xml” and “main activity kt”. With that being done I had to include Palettes in the activity main in order to start making the application, I used texts such as Text View and Plain Text including buttons.

My Applications title is “My History App” and it includes options of: Enter Age, Generate History, Clear and Show Results. After including the options I had to constrain them together in order for them to be in right places when I run the Application. With that being done I Had to change the background to Yellow which was the background of my choice, and I changed the Font for it to appear visible when I run the application. 
Now going on to the main Activity where I had to write my Codes, I had to research nine different names of celebrities who died and get to know at which age they died at, with the likes of Pele, Bob Ross and Chris Kyle. 

Here is what will happen when you ran the app. A student will enter a particular age as an input then it will compare the specific age to the age of the nine different people who passed away and it will then specify on which age they passed away. In much simple explanation, I created ana Android application that matches users age to famous historical figures. To get started I had to gather information on historical figures ages at the time of their passing. Then I designed the app interface and functionality. 
The app will provide students with more information and understanding of historical timelines by connecting them with the ages of people who passed away, this can help them with historical events and understand the lifespan of historical figures. And when students put their own age, they can see which historical figures died at the same or similar age.

The application can also make history more engaging for students by allowing them to see connections between their own lives and of those who passed away. Students can also use the application to check patterns and trends in the ages of those who passed away, which will  lead to discussions about different factors such as: Lifestyle, Health, and conditions in society that may have influenced longevity in different time periods.
The application can also serve as a starting point for research projects or assignments, encouraging students to explore the lives of the historical figures based on their age at death.

Therefore the Application will offer an interactive and engaging way for students to explore history, fostering a deeper understanding and appreciation of the past.
 The application will not only be beneficial to students only, users may feel a personal connection or relevance when they see historical figures who passed away at the same age they are currently in. The app could encourage users to reflect their own life and accomplishments in comparison to those who passed away who lived to similar age. Seeing the achievements and contributions of those who passed away might inspire users to achieve their own goals and ambitions.
 
The app could prompt users to consider their own mortality and make the most of their time, fostering a sense of urgency and purpose in their lives. Users may find it entertaining to discover which historical figures they share an age with and learn more about their lives. It could also spark conversations and connections between users of different generations, as they compare the ages of historical figures they are familiar with.
Such an Application could serve as both an educational tool and a source of personal reflection and inspirational for users. The app can also serve as a historical reference, providing information about the lives, achievements of famous individuals who are no longer alive. this can be valuable for students interested in the history of popular culture.

The application can offer a platform for fans to pay tribute and remember the famouse people. Highlighting the accomplishments and contributions of deceases celebrities, the application can educate students about various fields. it can also inspire future generations by showcasing the journeys and struggles these individuals faced on their path to being successful. As time passes, memories of past celebrities can fade. An application dedicated to deceased celebrities helps preserve their cultural significance for future generations, ensuring that their influence is not forgotten.

Students may find the app useful to analyse trends in celebrity culture, understanding the impact of media representation and exploring the dynamics of fame and being a celebrity. Overall the application can serve as both a resourse and a tribute, celebrating the lives and legacies of celebrities who have left a mark on popular culture.
